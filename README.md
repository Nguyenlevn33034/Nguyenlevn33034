## Introduction & Objective
I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Petroleum Engineering with research on application of Machine Learning and simulation software in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). I am interested in jobs related to Sustainable Energy and Renewable Energy as my future career, I also have some knowledge in fields such as Petroleum and Data Science. Moreover, I have participated in some competitions on the above fields and achieved certain achievements. I hope in the future I will find a good job related to simulation/data science in the Energy Industry.
